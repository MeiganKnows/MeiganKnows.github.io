                <h3>Contrast - Shutterfly</h3>
                <a href="https://www.shutterfly.com/">Shutterfly.com</a>
            </div>
            <p>In any design project, the contrast between different elements is important. There are different means of
                providing contrast in the design. It can be contrast between a bold, heavy font and a light whimsical
                font. In website design, one of the most important elements of contrast is the colors that are used. If
                the contrast between backgrounds and fonts isn’t high enough, then people will have a hard time reading
                and understanding what the site it trying to say. </p>
            <p>One example of good contrast is the Shutterfly site. Currently, they are running a special on photobooks
                for Mother’s Day. At the top of the page is a two part banner ad. They use bright orange and dark grey
                for the banner ads. Not only do these colors contrast with each other, but also with the white
                background. This draws attention right to the banner, the most important part of the page. </p>

                <h3>Fitts' Law - Typeform</h3>
                <a href="https://www.typeform.com">Typeform.com</a>
            </div>

            <p>Fitts’ Law is a whole lot of very complicated mathematical formulas that can calculate exactly how big an
                interface element should be. In 1954, Paul Morris Fitts published a paper with a metric to determine how
                difficult it would be to select a specified target. The ultimate application of the law, says that the
                most important interactive elements should be grouped together with other elements used at the same
                time, and as large as is reasonable for their importance. </p>
            <p>A good example of Fitts’ Law is the Typeform page. They are a Brazilian company that creates online
                surveys and forms. The sign up button is easy to find and large enough to be easy to press with your
                finger. The show me more button is also easy to find and big enough to be easy to press with your
                finger. </p>

                <h3>Hick's Law - Adrian Zumbrunnen</h3>
                <a href="https://azumbrunnen.me">AZumbrunnen.com</a>
            </div>
            <p>Hick’s Law, also know as the Hick-Hyman law, was named after psycologists William Edmund Hick and Ray
                Hyman. It says that the more options a person must choose from, the longer and harder that decision will
                be. One common application is restaurant menus. If they only serve two dishes, it is easier and quicker
                to decide then if they served ten dishes. The same theory applies to websites as well.</p>
            <p>An excellent example of this principle is Adrian Zumbrunnen’s website. He is a UX designer from Zurich,
                Switzerland. The website is set up like a text conversation and gives the user just a few options on how
                to proceed. They can scroll down to read more about him or select the options to have a “conversation”
                where Zumbrunnen will introduce himself. There is also the option to contact him. </p>
