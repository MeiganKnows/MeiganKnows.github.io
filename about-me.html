        I am from Arizona, specifically, the Mesa/Gilbert area near Phoenix. 
    </p>
    <p>I am the oldest of four children, and the only one who isn't married yet. It bothers my sister a
        whole lot more then it bothers me, honestly, but I don't really know why. I currently live in Mesa, AZ with my
        parents. My brother lives close by with his wife and daughter. My other brother lives in Seattle and my sister
        just moved to San Diego.
    </p>
    <p> I have not yet had the opportunity to serve a mission, but hope to one day, either with my husband if I
        get married, or as a single sister.
    </p>
    <p> I am currently in my second semester at BYU-I. I am working toward a degree in Applied Management, with a
        certificate in Web Frontend. I hope some day to continue on to graduate school and become a librarian.
    </p>
    <p> I love to go on adventures with my neice. Here is a picture of us headed to Phoenix on the lightrail to see the
        ballet.

        Another thing we like to do is play PokemonGo. You will often find us at the local park searching for the next
        item on our research list. <br>
        I have recently started watching Korean Drama, and have found a great interest in many of the stories told.
